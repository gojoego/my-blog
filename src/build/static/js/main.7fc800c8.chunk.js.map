Angelou:\nA Rock, A River, A Tree\nHosts to species long since departed,\nMarked the mastodon,\nThe dinosaur, who left dried tokens\nOf their sojourn here\nOn our planet floor,\nAny broad alarm of their hastening doom\nIs lost in the gloom of dust and ages.\n\nBut today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,\nCome, you may stand upon my\nBack and face your distant destiny,\nBut seek no haven in my shadow.\nI will give you no hiding place down here.\n\nYou, created only a little lower than\nThe angels, have crouched too long in\nThe bruising darkness\nHave lain too long\nFace down in ignorance.\nYour mouths spilling words\n\nArmed for slaughter.\nThe Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me,\nBut do not hide your face.\n\nAcross the wall of the world,\nA River sings a beautiful song. It says,\nCome, rest here by my side.\n\nEach of you, a bordered country,\nDelicate and strangely made proud,\nYet thrusting perpetually under siege.\nYour armed struggles for profit\nHave left collars of waste upon\nMy shore, currents of debris upon my breast.\nYet today I call you to my riverside,\nIf you will study war no more. Come,\nClad in peace, and I will sing the songs\nThe Creator gave to me when I and the\nTree and the rock were one.\nBefore cynicism was a bloody sear across your\nBrow and when you yet knew you still\nKnew nothing.\nThe River sang and sings on.\n\nThere is a true yearning to respond to\nThe singing River and the wise Rock.\nSo say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew\nThe African, the Native American, the Sioux,\nThe Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek\nThe Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheik,\nThe Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,\nThe privileged, the homeless, the Teacher.\nThey hear. They all hear\nThe speaking of the Tree.\n\nThey hear the first and last of every Tree\nSpeak to humankind today. Come to me, here beside the River.\nPlant yourself beside the River.\n\nEach of you, descendant of some passed\nOn traveller, has been paid for.\nYou, who gave me my first name, you,\nPawnee, Apache, Seneca, you\nCherokee Nation, who rested with me, then\nForced on bloody feet,\nLeft me to the employment of\nOther seekers—desperate for gain,\nStarving for gold.\nYou, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot,\nYou the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought,\nSold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare\nPraying for a dream.\nHere, root yourselves beside me.\nI am that Tree planted by the River,\nWhich will not be moved.\nI, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree\nI am yours—your passages have been paid.\nLift up your faces, you have a piercing need\nFor this bright morning dawning for you.\nHistory, despite its wrenching pain\nCannot be unlived, but if faced\nWith courage, need not be lived again.\n\nLift up your eyes upon\nThis day breaking for you.\nGive birth again\nTo the dream.\n\nWomen, children, men,\nTake it into the palms of your hands,\nMold it into the shape of your most\nPrivate need. Sculpt it into\nThe image of your most public self.\nLift up your hearts\nEach new hour holds new chances\nFor a new beginning.\nDo not be wedded forever\nTo fear, yoked eternally\nTo brutishness.\n\nThe horizon leans forward,\nOffering you space to place new steps of change.\nHere, on the pulse of this fine day\nYou may have the courage\nTo look up and out and upon me, the\nRock, the River, the Tree, your country.\nNo less to Midas than the mendicant.\nNo less to you now than the mastodon then.\n\nHere, on the pulse of this new day\nYou may have the grace to look up and out\nAnd into your sister’s eyes, and into\nYour brother’s face, your country\nAnd say simply\nVery simply\nWith hope—\nGood morning.\n    </p>\n    </>\n\n);\n\nexport default HomePage;","import React from 'react';\n\nconst AboutPage = () => (\n    <>\n    <h1>About Me</h1>\n    <p>\n        My favorite speech: \n\n        Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. (Civil Rights Leader): Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\n\nBut 100 years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later...\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: ...the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men - yes, black men as well as white men - would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked insufficient funds.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER\n\nDr. KING: We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: We have also come to his hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time...\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: ...to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\n\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\n\nThere are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, when will you be satisfied? We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: for whites only.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our Northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.\n\nLet us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\n\nSOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE\n\nDr. KING: This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning: My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims' pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.\n\nAnd if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that, let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.\n\nAnd when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last. Free at last. Thank God almighty, we are free at last.\n    </p>\n    </>\n\n);\n\nexport default AboutPage;","import React from 'react';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nconst ArticlesList = ({ articles }) => (\n    <>     \n    {articles.map((article, key) => (\n        <Link className=\"article-list-item\" key={key} to={`/article/${article.name}`}>\n            <h3>{article.title}</h3>\n            <p>{article.content[0].substring(0, 150)}...</p>\n        </Link>\n    ))}\n    </>\n);\n\nexport default ArticlesList;","const articles = [\n    {\n        name: 'learn-react',\n        title: 'The Fastest Way to Learn React',\n        content: [\n            `Welcome!
